### Data Preparation
- Removing Redundant Data and Renaming Columns: As seen above, there is an unnecessary header row ‚ÄúAAPL‚Äù. We go ahead to remove this unnecessary header row as it has no use.
- Data Type Conversion: The 'Date' column is converted to the correct datetime data type, allowing for proper time-series analysis. Other numeric columns are also converted to their appropriate numeric types, facilitating calculations and visualizations.
- Cleaned Data: The final cleaned_dataDataFrame is well-structured, with appropriate column names and data types, ready for in-depth analysis.

##### Observation
- Red dots represent high-volume outliers, primarily clustered in early 2020.
- Multiple spikes above 300 million in volume highlight extraordinary events in early 2020
- After 2020, outliers become less frequent, suggesting that abnormal trading activity subsided.
- Late 2024: Isolated outliers suggest a resurgence in market activity, possibly due to external factors like news, earnings reports, or economic events.
